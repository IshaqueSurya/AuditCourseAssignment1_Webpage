# Creating A Replica Of The Provided Webpage
In this assignment, I have created a webpage replica that consists of elements such as navbar, images, various shapes, buttons, transition animations and much more.

The main component I got to learn while creating this webpage is the use of **CSS Flexbox Layout Module**.

The Flexbox Layout Module allows the creation of a responsive webpage without using float, and positioning.

## Some of the Flexbox properties I used in this project are:

**1) display: flex:** Allows us to set the layout of an element to Flexbox.

**2) flex-direction:** This property defines the direction in which the container wants to stack the flex items.

**3) justify-content:** This property is used to align the flex items.

**4) align-items:** This property is also used to align the flex items inside the container.

**5) flex-grow:** This property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.

## Some other properties that I explored while creating this webpage:

**1) z-index:** This property specifies the stack order of an element.

**2) transform:** This property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. In this webpage we used translation and rotation transformations.

**3) transition:** This property is used to adjust the transition effect properties on an element

**4) cursor:** Used to set the cursor that is shown on an element when mouse cusor is hovered over it

## Some other properties I used in this project that we learned about in the last task:

1) width
2) height
3) border
4) border-radius
5) margin
6) padding
7) font-weight
8) font-size
9) background-color
10) text-align
